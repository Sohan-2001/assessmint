// This file is intentionally left almost empty to signify that Prisma is no longer
// being used for database schema management or as an ORM in this project.
// Database interactions are now handled directly via the 'pg' library (node-postgres)
// connected to Neon PostgreSQL.

// The SQL DDL for table creation can be found in `schema.sql`.
// You need to run the DDL statements in `schema.sql` directly against your NeonDB
// (e.g., using the Neon SQL Editor or a SQL client) to set up the database tables.

// If you decide to reintroduce Prisma in the future, you would populate this file
// with your Prisma schema definition.

  provider = "postgresql" // This is just a placeholder
